# scripts

These are some scripts I've found useful.

* **hidehidden** hides all normally hidden files on Mac OS X. These are files with names starting with '.'. 
* **showhidden** shows all normally hidden files on Mac OS X. These are files with name starting with '.'.
* **startJupyter** launches Jupyter, assuming you have installed [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Note: you may want to modify the path in the second line of the script.
